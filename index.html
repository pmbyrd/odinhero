            <b>Cheesecake... </b>New York style, Japanese style, Cheesecake Factory unimagionable decadant treats.  The varsitility of cheese to transform from savory to sweet is why it is one of my personal favorite foods.

            I know, I know, it's made with cream cheese, but it has cheese in the name and instead of arguing about techinicalities, I'll enjoy a cheat day treat a rich creamy goodness.
